\textbf{1a}
\\
Given that $\phi = V^\mu U_\mu$, where $V^\mu$ is any four-vector, prove that $U_\mu$ is a four-vector.
\\
\\
To show that $U_\mu$ is a four-vector, we must show that it transforms as a four-vector under a Lorentz transformation.  First, take the Lorentz transform of both sides
\\
\\
$\phi^\prime = \Lambda^\nu_{\;\mu} V^\mu U^\prime_\nu$
\\
$V^\mu U_\mu = \Lambda^\nu_{\;\mu} V^\mu U^\prime_\nu$
\\
so, 
\\
$V^\mu U_\mu - \Lambda^\nu_{\;\mu} V^\mu U^\prime_\nu = 0$
\\
$V^\mu \left(U_\mu - \Lambda^\nu_{\;\mu} U^\prime_\nu\right) = 0$
\\
$V^\mu$ can be any vector, so we must have 
\\
$\left(U_\mu - \Lambda^\nu_{\;\mu} U^\prime_\nu\right) = 0$
\\
$U_\mu = \Lambda^\nu_{\;\mu} U^\prime_\nu$
\\
\\
Now, we just need to invert the Lorentz transform on the right and apply it to the left hand side and we're done.  The matrix identity that defines the Lorentz transform, 
\\
$\Lambda \eta \Lambda^T = \eta$
\\
can be used to get the inverse of the Lorentz Transform.  We want a Lorentz transform written as $\Lambda^{\;\mu}_\alpha$.  The transform written this way will invert the transform on the right hand side above and is the correct transform to apply to the left hand side.  The matrix identity can be written in index notation as 
\\
$\Lambda_\mu^{\;\sigma} \eta_{\sigma \rho} \Lambda_\nu^{\;\rho} = \eta_{\sigma\rho}$
\\
Note that the second two terms of the lhs are contracted on their columns making the second Lorentz transform a transpose.  Also notice that the first two terms contract with a free row and a free column, i.e., the column in the first term is contracted onto the row of the second as in a normal matrix multiply.
\\
$\Lambda_\mu^{\;\sigma} \eta_{\sigma \rho} \Lambda_\nu^{\;\rho} = \eta_{\mu\nu}$
\\
$  = \Lambda_\mu^{\;\sigma} \Lambda_{\nu\sigma} = \eta_{\mu\nu}$
\\
Now, raise the second index on the second transform
\\
$\eta^{\nu\alpha} \Lambda_\mu^{\;\sigma} \Lambda_{\nu\sigma} = \eta^{\nu\alpha} \eta_{\mu\nu}$
\\
$\Lambda_\mu^{\;\sigma} \Lambda^\alpha_{\;\sigma} = \delta^\alpha_\mu$
\\
so,
\\
$\left(\Lambda^\alpha_{\;\sigma}\right)^{-1} = \Lambda_\mu^{\;\sigma}$
\\
Now that we have the inverse, we can apply it to both sides to get
\\
$\Lambda_\sigma^{\;\mu} U_\mu = \Lambda^\nu_{\;\mu} U^\prime_\nu \Lambda_\sigma^{\;\mu} $
\\
$\Lambda_\sigma^{\;\mu} U_\mu = U^\prime_\sigma$
\\
$U^\prime_\sigma = \Lambda_\sigma^{\;\mu} U_\mu$
\\
This proves that $U$ transforms as a four-vector, and is in fact a four-vector.
\\

\textbf{1.b.}
\\
First, even though, they're not required, a few notes on swapping dummy indices up and down.  As it turns out,
\\
$B^\mu A_mu = B_mu A^mu$
\\
Here's why.  We can write $A_mu$ as
\\
$A_mu = \eta_{\mu\rho}A^\rho$
\\
Now we have
\\
$B^\mu A_mu = B^\mu \eta_{\mu\rho} A^\rho$
\\
$B^\mu A_mu = \eta_{\mu\rho} B^\mu A^\rho$
\\
$B^\mu A_mu = B_\mu A^\rho$
\\
\\
The actual problem to be worked is to show that
\\
$S_{\mu\nu} = W_{\mu\rho}W_\nu^{\;\;\rho}$
\\
is symmetric
\\
First, we permute indices to get
$S_{\nu\mu} = W_{\nu\rho}W_\mu^{\;\;\rho}$
\\
But, this isn't the same as the original expression yet, so we swap our dummy indices up and down to get 
\\
$S_{\nu\mu} = W_{\nu}^{\;\;\rho}W_\mu\rho$
\\
$= W_\mu\rho W_{\nu}^{\;\;\rho}$
\\
Which is identical to the original expression for $S_{\mu\nu}$ demonstrating symmetry.

\textbf{2}
\\
If a four-vector is timelike then $V^\mu V_\mu < 0$.  If it's spacelike then $V^\mu V_\mu > 0 $.  Lightlike vectors have $V^\mu V_\mu = 0$.  Suppose $k_\mu$ is a null vector.  Show that if a non-spacelike vector, $V^\mu$ is orthogonal to $k^\mu$ i.e. $k^\mu V_\mu = 0$ then $V^\mu$ is a multiple of $k^\mu$.
\\
$k^\mu V_\mu = 0 = k^\mu k_\mu$
\\
from the fact that $k_\mu$ is null.
\\
$k^\mu v_\mu - k^mu k_\mu = 0$
\\
$k^\mu\left(V_\mu - k_\mu\right) = 0$
\\
$V_\mu - k_\mu = 0$
\\
$v_\mu = k_\mu$
\\

\textbf{3.a.}
\\
Using the definition of the infintesimal Lorentz transform, $\Lambda^\mu_{\;\nu} = \left(\delta^\mu_\nu + \lambda^\mu_{\;\nu}\right)$, 
express $\delta x^\mu = x^{\prime\mu} - x^\mu$ in terms of $\lambda^\mu_{\;\nu}$
\\
We know that 
\\
$\Lambda^\mu_{\;\nu} = \dfrac{dx^{\prime\mu}}{dx^\nu}$
\\
So, a small change in $dx^\nu$ results in 
\\
$dx^\nu \Lambda^\mu_{\;\nu} = dx^{\prime \mu}$
\\
$dx^\nu\left(\delta^\mu_\nu + \lambda^\mu_{\;\nu}\right) = dx^{\prime\mu}$
\\
Where the above substitutes the defition of the incremental Lorentz transform,
\\
$\Lambda^\mu_{\;\nu} = \left(\delta^\mu_\nu + \lambda^\mu_{\;\nu}\right)$
\\
$\delta_\nu^\mu dx^\nu + dx^\nu lambda^\mu_{\;\nu} = dx^{\prime\mu}$
\\
$dx^=mu + \lambda^\mu_{\;\nu} dx^\nu = dx^{\prime\mu}$
\\
$\lambda^\mu_{\;\nu}dx^\nu = dx^{\prime\mu} - dx^\mu$
\\
$\lambda^mu_{\;\nu} dx^\nu = \delta x^\mu$
\\
NOTE:  This jibes with what's late stated in 3.c.  The only thing left to do is check that $dx^{\prime\mu} - dx^\mu$ is an acceptable rendering of $x^{\prime\mu} - x^\mu$
\\
\\
\PRLsep
\\
\\
\textbf{3.b.}
\\
Show that $\lambda^\mu_{\;\nu}$ is anti-symmetric, using the defition of the Lorentz transfrome, $\eta_{\mu\nu} \Lambda^\nu_{\;\sigma}\Lambda^\mu_{\;\rho} = \eta_{\rho\sigma}$
\\
Keeping in mind that $\Lambda^\nu_{\;\sigma} = \delta\mu_\nu + \lambda^\nu_{\;\sigma}$, show that $\lambda^\nu_{\;\sigma} = -\lambda^\nu_{\;\sigma}$
\\
$\eta_{\mu\nu}\left(\delta\mu_\rho+ \lambda^\mu_{\;\rho}\right)\left(\delta^\nu_\sigma + \lambda^\nu_{\;\sigma}\right) = \eta_{\rho\sigma}$
\\
\\
$\eta_{\mu\nu}\left(\delta^{\mu\nu}_{\rho\sigma} + \delta^\nu_\sigma \lambda^\mu_{\;\rho} + \delta^\mu_rho \lambda^\nu_{\;\sigma} + \lambda^\mu_{\;\rho}\lambda^\nu_{\;\sigma}\right) = \eta_{\rho\sigma}$
\\
\\
The product of two infintesimal $\lambda$s above is taken to be zero.
\\
\\
$\eta_{\rho\sigma} + \delta^\nu_\sigma \lambda_{\nu\rho} + \delta^\mu_\rho\Lambda_{\mu\sigma} = \eta_{\rho\sigma}$
\\
\\
For the above to evaluate correctly, we must have 
\\
$\lambda_{\sigma\rho} - \lambda_{\rho\sigma} = 0$
\\
So, 
\\
$\lambda_{\sigma\rho} = -\lambda_{\rho\sigma}$
\\
\\

\textbf{3.c.}
\\
Notes on how to approach the problem.  Notice that the experssion in 3.c. comes from Dirac's article.  Also keep in mind that $M_{\mu\nu}$looks like a cross product and also looks like a similarity trnaformation once applied.  Also, it looks like the answer for the last part of 3a is contained in 3c. 
\\
$\Lambda^i_{\; j} = \delta_{ij} + \dfrac{\gamma - 1}{v^2} v_i v_j$
\\
We'll need this for part 2.d. if not sooner
\\
$\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma_1 & -\gamma_1 v_1\\
-\gamma_1 v_1 & \gamma_1\\
\end{pmatrix} 
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma_2 & -\gamma_2 v_2\\
-\gamma_2 v_2 & \gamma_2\\
\end{pmatrix} $
\\
$  = \gamma_1 \gamma_2 
\begin{pmatrix}
v_1 v_2 + 1 & -v_2 - v_1\\
-v_1 - v_2 & v_1 v_2 + 1\\
\end{pmatrix} $
\\
Now, if we just bludgeon through we get
\\
$\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma_2 & -\gamma_2 v_2\\
-\gamma_2 v_2 & \gamma_2\\
\end{pmatrix} 
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma_1 & -\gamma_1 v_1\\
-\gamma_1 v_1 & \gamma_1\\
\end{pmatrix} $
\\
$  = \gamma_1 \gamma_2 
\begin{pmatrix}
v_1 v_2 + 1 & -v_2 - v_1\\
-v_1 - v_2 & v_1 v_2 + 1\\
\end{pmatrix} $
\\
They produce the same results and therefore commute.  Since we can always adjust our coordinate system so that the velocities lie along the x axis, this result holds for any direction of velocity as long as both boosts are parallel as stated in the problem.
