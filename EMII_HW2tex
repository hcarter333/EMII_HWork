{\bf 3}\\
This problem focuses on deriving the Lorentz transform for the $\vec{B}$ field.  First though, let's look at the result we want to get and compare it to the space Lorentz transform.  The general Lorentz transform for space is:
\\
$\vec{r}^\prime = \vec{r} + \dfrac{\gamma - 1}{v^2} \left(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{r}\right)\vec{v} - \gamma \vec{v} t$
\\
What's going on here is that the portion of the $\vec{r}$ vector parallel to the velocity vector is being subtracted away from the total posiition vector.  
\\
$\vec{r} - \dfrac{\left(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{r}\right)\vec{v}}{v^2}$
\\
because it is broken with respect the Lorentz transform.  Remember that the portions for the position vector perpendicular to the velocity are unaffected, so they remain untouched.  We then plug back in the Lorentz corrected portion of the position vector.
\\
$\gamma \left(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{r}\right)\vec{v}$
\\
And, of course, we have the  $\gamma \vec{v} t$ term which reflects the rotation of the space into the time dimension.
\\
All in all, we can express the position transform as 
\\
$\vec{r}^\prime = \vec{r} - \vec{r}_\parallel + \gamma\vec{r}_\parallel -\gamma\vec{v}t
\\$
\\
Now, let's look at the final result we're shooting for in the $\vec{B}$ field transformation.  From eq. 252 we have
\\
$\vec{B}^\prime = \gamma \left(\vec{B} - \vec{v} \times \vec{E}\right) - \dfrac{\gamma - 1}{v^2}\left(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{B}\right)\vec{v}$
\\
This is a little different, first, notice that the untransformed $\vec{B}$ field is now multiplied by $\gamma$.
\\
Leaving that aside for the moment, we're still pulling out the broken parallel portion ala 
\\
$\gamma\vec{B} - \dfrac{\left(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{B}\right)\vec{v}}{v^2}$
\\
Well, sort of, there's still that factor of $\gamma$ there.  Let's try this a different way.  Embrace the gamma and write the first term as a sum of parallel and perpendicular fields.
\\
$\gamma\vec{B} = \gamma\vec{B}_\parallel + \gamma\vec{B}_\perp$
\\
Now, we see that we're really pulling the transformed parallel portion out while leaving an untransformed version of the parallel portion in...
\\
$\gamma\vec{B}_\parallel + \gamma\vec{B}_\perp - \gamma\vec{B}_\parallel + \vec{B}_\parallel$
\\
The end result is the original parallel B field with a $\gamma$ adjusted perpendicular portion.
\\
$\vec{B}^\prime = \vec{B}_\parallel + \gamma\vec{B}_\perp - \vec{v} \times \vec{E}$
\\
Karapetoff or Sommerfeld mentioned the reason the parallel component of the field cannot be modified, I've simply forgotten.  I'll look it up.
\\
Let's take a quick look at the expression for the E field as well and see if it has the properties in regards to it's parallel and perpendicular components.\\
$\vec{E}^\prime = \gamma \left(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}\right) - \dfrac{\gamma - 1}{v^2}\left(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{E}\right)\vec{v}$
\\
This gives,
\\
$\vec{E}^\prime = \vec{E}_\parallel + \gamma\vec{E}_\perp + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}$
\\
Next Step:  Look up Karapetoff or Sommerfeld explanation for  parallel field.

Next Step: label the above as notes
